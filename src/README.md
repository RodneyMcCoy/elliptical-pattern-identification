Uh, i dont have the slightest idea how to build the project, and how the code works. 
It didn't seem like Malachi new someone else would be using his code when he originally wrote it.
So ill hopefully find some time to figure it out and describe it here 
(a more concise verison of what i find will go in the README in the main directory).


This and makeing a writeup of the actual algorithm / technique of what we will be implimenting is 
going to be my main work for the capstone project, atleast the first semester. 
These seem to be the first bottleneck in the way of you two doing some work yourself,
 so ill try to get these mostly done by October. 
After that, ill leave most of the work to you two until atleast next semester.
(Although, putting this here might be redundant since will probably discuss this when we meet again)

- [Repo currently in src folder](https://github.com/malachiRivkin/hodographAnalysis)
- [Idk what this is, might have useful information](https://github.com/malachiRivkin/gravity-wave-gui-matlab)


## SRC Folder Summary

- utilityScripts
  - "this directory contains a variety of programs I have created to test ideas, learn analysis 	techniques, and troubleshoot problems. None are essential for analysis, but provide some insight to the evolution of the main analysis script. It also contains the original hodograph code from Thomas Colligan that I ported over to Python. "
- Tolten, Villarica 
  - Contains flight data. Will be moved to *test* folder in the future
- .spyproject
  - Idk what this is. Probabily a folder type specific to the spyder ide
- .idea
  - This is an ide specific folder for jetbrains.
